# prjkt-last-pencil
work on the python project
Description
An interesting idea has come to your mind. Let's change the rules of game. Players take turns taking X pencils until none of them remain.

Objectives
Expand your program by creating a loop. Each player takes turns removing pencils until 0 pencils remain on the table. Each iteration prints 2 lines: lines with pencils (vertical bars) and whose turn is now by printing the *NameX*'s turn string.

Examples
The greater-than symbol followed by a space (> ) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.

Example 1:

How many pencils would you like to use:
> 5
Who will be the first (John, Jack):
> John
|||||
John's turn:
> 2
|||
Jack's turn:
> 1
||
John's turn:
> 2
Example 2:

How many pencils would you like to use:
> 15
Who will be the first (John, Jack):
> John
|||||||||||||||
John's turn:
> 8
|||||||
Jack's turn:
> 7
